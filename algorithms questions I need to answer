You want to build a really big sign which says "HELLO". You have a catalogue of letters which you can buy. Sometimes you can buy two or more letters stuck together. For example, maybe your catalogue has the following prices:

H: $4
E: $3
L: $4
O: $2
EL: $5

The optimal way to make the sign is to piece it together with the pieces H, EL, L, O.

Write an algorithm which takes a string and the prices of a catalogue and returns the best way to build the string.
