Things about sorted lists:

- Sorting is O(n log n)
- Getting the kth smallest element is O(n)
- Getting the m elementsÂ from k onwards:
  - Make a heap, takes O(n log k) + O(k log m)
  - Select a bunch of times, takes O(n * m)

- If you map over it and sort it again, you didn't need to sort it originally.
