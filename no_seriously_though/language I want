I want to make a language which compiles to Ruby, Scala, Python, Javascript, etc. Making it compile to C is probably a lot harder, unless I consider memory management from the start and just ignore it in automatically memory managed languages.

for example:

class BinarySearchTree[A](value: ) {
  def initialize()
}
