# Searching through alternative implementations

Often there are different ways of doing a particular thing, like getting the third smallest element of a list. list.sorted.get(2) can be done using the linear time select algorithm. I need to be able to represent this piece of knowledge.

Often you can store additional data in a data structure, like its sum or the cached result of certain computations, or a tree allowing you to get subarray sums or whatever. I want to represent this somehow. Maybe all data structures should be represented this way.
