# Goals

Here are a long list of problems I would like my DSgen to solve.

Build data structures for:

- Stack
- Min-stack
- Queue
- Min-queue
- Hash set
- Stack with fast contains
- Stack with fast count
- List with append, set, get
- List with average
- List with get, set, insert, remove
- List with get, append, average
- Priority queue
- Priority queue with two different priorities
- Priority queue with non-unique keys
- Set with fast "get nearest item"
- List with fast "get nearest value"
- Array with fast subarray sums
- Stack with fast subarray sums
- Collection with getMax
- Collection with just getTenthLargest

A few things about this:

- you can usually start out with a hash map if it's a map
- sometimes you don't actually need to store the data, e.g. if get is never called
