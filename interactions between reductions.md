If I want to have a collection which also stores the sum, then I update it every time I change any element, using subtraction if necessary.
If I have a collection which stores the minimum, then I can't do that, because min isn't invertable. I can store a min heap though.

"Make a collection which has get, set, and getParity." In this case, parity is associative, commutative, and invertable.


Sum heaps....
